Love Letter: {Happy 25 months to us, my babi. 

For 25 months, we’ve been officially together—and what a journey it has been. We’ve had our ups and downs, moments of peace and misunderstanding, laughter and tears. But my favorite part of our story isn’t just the happy days—it’s the days when everything feels heavy and hard, yet we still choose each other. Every single time.

As the days pass, our love only grows stronger. I pray that God continues to guide and preserve what we have, especially since we can’t see what the future holds. But one thing I hold onto is this hope—that this love of ours will one day begin again at the aisle and only end when we reach our graves.

Happy 25th monthsary, my buding. My only buding.

Little Note {
    These songs aren’t just melodies to us—they’re memories. 🎶  Each one holds a piece of our story, from quiet nights and long talks to the moments when words weren’t enough but the music understood us. These are the songs we played the most, the ones that carried our theme, our emotions, and our love.
